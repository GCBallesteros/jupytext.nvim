# Jupytext.nvim

Seamlessly open [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) as there associated
plain text alternatives. Powered by [jupytext](https://www.github.com/mwouts/jupytext).

`jupytext.nvim` is a lua port of the original
[jupytext.vim](https://www.github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) with some additional
features and a simpler configuration.

## Installation
`lazy.nvim` example:
```lua
return {
  "GCBallesteros/jupytext.nvim",
  config = true,
  -- Depending on your nvim distro or config you may need to make the loading not lazy
  -- lazy=false,
}
```


For `jupytext.nvim` to run correctly you will also need to make sure that you
have the `jupytext` CLI installed (`pip install jupytext`).

If `jupytext` is available and yet when you open a notebook you still see a wall
of inscrutable JSON then it may be that `jupytext.nvim` wasn't available due
to lazy loading. The easiest fix is to not lazy load this plugin. For example
if using `lazy.nvim` just set `lazy=false`. This plugin is tiny and will be a
rounding error on your startup time.

## Configuration

The simplest configuration only requires you to decide what plain text
representation you want jupytext to output. The default configuration is:

```lua
{
  style = "hydrogen",
  output_extension = "auto",  -- Default extension. Don't change unless you know what you are doing
  force_ft = nil,  -- Default filetype. Don't change unless you know what you are doing
  custom_language_formatting = {},
}
```

By default, the extension of the plain text file is automatically selected by
jupytext. This can be modified by changing the extension from `auto` to any
other file extension supported by Jupytext. This is most useful to those using
Quarto or Markdown. Analogously, we can provide a default filetype that will be
given to the new buffer by using `force_ft`. Again, this is only really useful
to users of Quarto.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some combinations of style and extensions are incompatible and Jupytext will
> fail if you attempt them, e.g. the `md` extension with the `quarto` style.
> You will see this as an error from the `read_ipynb` function.

If you need something different pass your own configuration to
`require("jupytext").setup`, e.g.

```lua
require("jupytext").setup({ style = "light" })
```

> [!TIP]
> Quarto and markdown format users keep on reading!

By default we use the `auto` mode of jupytext. This will create a script with
the correct extension for each language. However, this can be overridden in a
per language basis if you want to. For this add to the configuration options a
field named `custom_language_formatting` which contains a series of per
language fields. For example, to convert python files to quarto markdown:

```lua
custom_language_formatting = {
  python = {
    extension = "qmd",
    style = "quarto",
    force_ft = "quarto", -- you can set whatever filetype you want here
  },
}
```

Or, for regular markdown:

```lua
custom_language_formatting = {
  python = {
    extension = "md",
    style = "markdown",
    force_ft = "markdown", -- you can set whatever filetype you want here
  },
}
```

Setting force_ft is important to get other plugins like
[otter.nvim](https://github.com/jmbuhr/otter.nvim) working correctly.


## Acknowledgements
This plugin is a lua port of [goerz/jupytext.vim](https://www.github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) and it wouldn't have existed without it.
